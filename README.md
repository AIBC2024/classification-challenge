# ISP Spam Filtering Model
Supervised Machine Learning - Regression Model vs Random Forest Model Homework AI Bootcamp due 3/11/2025

## Project Overview
1. From spam_detector Jupyter Notebook file create data frames, follow instructions to achieve accuracy level from both models.
2. Apply my understanding of the Regression Model vs Random Forest Model Supervised Machine Learning algorithm. Examine the 2 models and write down my analysis.

## How I did my work
1. Follow the instructions on the Jupyter Notebook starter file
2. Use lesson 13_1, 13_2, and 13_3 for the command lines
3. Read more on the https://scikit-learn.org/ and in depth search via Claude AI
4. Debug and test multiple times

## Output Examples
